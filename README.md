#  🍅 Pomotama

A Pomofocus clone with React and TypeScript. I love Pomofocus.io so much that I'm basically using it every day while doing tasks. While it's being really helpful to my productivity flow, I feel like I can improve the app to suit my need more. Therefore, I built this side project for both learning purposes and personal usage.
